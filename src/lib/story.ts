  "Christian's love for baked goods and baking came from a combination of his dad's love of baked goods and the love his mom had for cooking and hospitality. \nOne of Christian's fondest memory growing up was having breakfast with his parents on the weekends. This was usually the time where his whole came together as a whole and ate breakfast together. Not one weekend would go by where his dad did not have a baked good in his hands with cup of coffee. Nowadays he cherishes bringing croissants or some pastries back when he visits his parents to share a nice cup of coffee. \n";
